## 🎯 Search Strategy

### Search Patterns (7 per location+industry)
For each combination of location and industry, we search:
1. `{industry} in {location}`
2. `{industry} {location} New York`
3. `best {industry} {location}`
4. `{location} {industry} directory`
5. `{industry} near {location}`
6. `{location} NY {industry}`
7. `{industry} businesses {location}`

**Example**: For "Financial District" + "restaurant":
- "restaurant in Financial District"
- "restaurant Financial District New York"
- "best restaurant Financial District"
- "Financial District restaurant directory"
- "restaurant near Financial District"
- "Financial District NY restaurant"
- "restaurant businesses Financial District"

### Rate Limiting
- **2.5 seconds** between searches
- **~24 searches per minute**
- **~1,440 searches per hour**
- Conservative to avoid IP blocks

## 🎮 Control Commands

### Start All Systems
```bash
cd /workspaces/Data-Bunker/backend
bash scripts/start-all-background.sh
```

### Stop All Systems
```bash
cd /workspaces/Data-Bunker/backend
bash scripts/stop-all-background.sh
```

### Monitor Real-Time Status
```bash
cd /workspaces/Data-Bunker/backend
bash scripts/monitor-status.sh
```

### Watch Discovery Log
```bash
tail -f /workspaces/Data-Bunker/backend/logs/discovery.log
```

### Watch Enrichment Log
```bash
tail -f /workspaces/Data-Bunker/backend/logs/enrichment.log
```

### Check Database Progress
```bash
docker exec -i data-bunker-db psql -U postgres -d databunker -c "
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(website) as with_website,
    COUNT(phone) as with_phone,
    COUNT(email) as with_email,
    COUNT(address_line_1) as with_address
FROM companies 
WHERE jurisdiction='us_ny';
"
```

### View Completed Areas
```bash
cat /workspaces/Data-Bunker/backend/data/ny-completed-areas.json
```

### Count Completed Areas
```bash
cat /workspaces/Data-Bunker/backend/data/ny-completed-areas.json | grep -o ',' | wc -l
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Discovery Process
1. **Load Progress**: Checks for previous progress to resume from
2. **Iterate Locations**: Goes through each borough → neighborhood
3. **Iterate Industries**: For each location, searches all industries
4. **Multiple Search Patterns**: Uses 7 different search queries per combination
5. **Extract Companies**: Parses search results for company names and websites
6. **Check Duplicates**: Verifies company doesn't already exist
7. **Save to Database**: Inserts new company with jurisdiction='us_ny'
8. **Track Progress**: Marks area as completed
9. **Save Checkpoint**: Every 50 searches, saves progress
10. **Continue**: Moves to next area

### Enrichment Process (for each discovered company)
1. **Website Discovery**: If no website, tries to discover it
2. **Website Scraping**: Scrapes main page and contact page
3. **🆕 Search-Based Discovery**: 
   - Searches: `"Company Name" location phone number`
   - Searches: `"Company Name" location address`
   - Searches: `"Company Name" location contact`
   - Extracts data from search snippets
4. **Save Contacts**: Updates phone, email, address
5. **UK Officer Enrichment**: If UK company, fetches officers
6. **Mark Complete**: Updates `last_updated` timestamp

## 🎯 Completed Areas List

As the system runs, completed areas are saved in JSON format:

```json
[
  "manhattan:Financial District:restaurant",
  "manhattan:Financial District:cafe",
  "manhattan:Financial District:bakery",
  "manhattan:Financial District:pizzeria",
  "manhattan:Financial District:retail",
  "manhattan:Tribeca:restaurant",
  ...
]
```

**Total possible combinations**: 183 locations × 93 industries = **17,019 searches**

This list grows continuously and can be used to:
- Resume from where it left off if interrupted
- Track which areas have been thoroughly searched
- Identify remaining areas to search
- Generate progress reports

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Graceful Shutdown
Both systems handle SIGINT/SIGTERM:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C or use stop script
bash scripts/stop-all-background.sh
```
- Saves progress before exiting
- No data loss
- Can resume from last checkpoint

### Automatic Recovery
If a search fails:
- Error is logged
- System continues to next search
- Failed area can be retried later

### Duplicate Prevention
- Checks database before inserting
- Uses lowercase name matching
- Prevents duplicate companies

### Rate Limiting
- 2.5 second delay between searches
- Prevents IP blocking
- Respectful to search engines

## 💡 Tips

### To Speed Up Discovery
- Increase workers: Enrichment can handle more workers
- Multiple discovery processes: Run different boroughs separately
- Reduce delay: Lower `searchDelay` (risk: IP blocks)

### To Improve Data Quality
- Let enrichment workers run for days
- They continuously retry failed companies
- Contact data improves over time

### To Check Specific Area
```bash
# See if an area was completed
cat backend/data/ny-completed-areas.json | grep "Brooklyn:Williamsburg"
```

### To Get Statistics
```bash
# View stats file
cat backend/data/ny-discovery-stats.json | python3 -m json.tool
```
